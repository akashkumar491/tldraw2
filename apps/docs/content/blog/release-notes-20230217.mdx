We’re back with another Friday release! It’s the calm before the storm right now, as we’re getting closer to open-sourcing our [state management library](https://twitter.com/tldraw/status/1617931796968263680). In the meantime, we’ve been pushing out more features and fixes for the tldraw beta. Try out the changes for yourself at [beta.tldraw.com](https://beta.tldraw.com).

> Want to test out our multiplayer? [Join the party room!](https://beta.tldraw.com/r/its_friday?page=page%3A2yW9EcUyos6_TITii8PTa&viewport=5388%2C-1498%2C606%2C644)

Please let us know what you think about this week’s release! If you have any feedback, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rhsyWMUJxd) or make an issue on the [public repo](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-beta).

## What’s new

You can now link to a **chosen location** of a multiplayer project.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd859a858-4d3c-4954-974a-5d301d94aa8b_720x406.gif)

To try this out, first make a multiplayer project by clicking the **Share** button. Then move the camera to the location you want to link to.

Now copy the page’s URL from your address bar. Share the link with others to let them join at your chosen location.

> You could also attach the link to a shape. Right-click on a shape and click the **Edit link** button to give it a try.

## Improvements

We improved the appearance of the **eraser tool**. Its trail now tapers off more smoothly, and it works better on screens with high refresh-rates.

> This change also affects **scribble-selecting**. Hold down the alt or option key while using the select tool to select any shapes that you scribble over.

You shouldn’t ever see this, but we also adjusted our error screen’s appearance so that it fades the background behind it.
