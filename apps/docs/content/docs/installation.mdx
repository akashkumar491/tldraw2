First, install the `@tldraw/tldraw` package using `@alpha` for the **latest alpha release**. It also has peer dependencies on `signia` and `signia-react` which you will need to install at the same time.

```bash
yarn add @tldraw/tldraw@alpha signia signia-react
# or
npm install @tldraw/tldraw@alpha signia signia-react
```

Next, copy the following folders: `icons`, `embed-icons`, `fonts`, and `translations` from the [assets folder](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/assets). Put them in your project's public path so that, e.g. `your-website.com/icons` points to the icons folder you copied. (Ability to customize the base asset URL is coming soon!)
