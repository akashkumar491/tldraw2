At the moment the `@tldraw/tldraw` package is in alpha. We also ship a canary version which is always up to date with the main branch of tldraw [repository](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw).

## Alpha

First, install the `@tldraw/tldraw` package using `@alpha` for the latest.

```bash
yarn add @tldraw/tldraw@alpha
# or
npm install @tldraw/tldraw@alpha
```

## Canary

To get the very latest version, use the [latest canary release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tldraw/tldraw?activeTab=versions). Docs for the very latest version are also available at [canary.tldraw.dev](https://canary.tldraw.dev).

```bash
yarn add @tldraw/tldraw@canary
# or
npm install @tldraw/tldraw@canary
```
