Welcome to the tldraw developer docs.

tldraw is a React component that you can use to create infinite canvas experiences for the web. It is essentially the [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com) application wrapped up and distributed as a React component, but with powerful APIs for creating custom shapes, tools, behaviors, and user interfaces elements.

These docs relate to tldraw's **alpha version**, which is [open source](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw), permissively licensed under Apache 2.0, and available [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tldraw/tldraw) under the alpha and canary versions.

And if you are just looking for the regular tldraw app, try [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com).

## Installation

First, install the `@tldraw/tldraw` package using `@alpha` for the **latest alpha release**.  The package also has peer dependencies on `signia` and `signia-react` which you will need to install at the same time.

```bash
yarn add @tldraw/tldraw@alpha signia signia-react
# or
npm install @tldraw/tldraw@alpha signia signia-react
```

To get the very latest version, use the [latest canary release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tldraw/tldraw?activeTab=versions). Docs for the very latest version are also available at [canary.tldraw.dev](https://canary.tldraw.dev).

```bash
yarn add @tldraw/tldraw@canary signia signia-react
# or
npm install @tldraw/tldraw@canary signia signia-react
```

## Usage

You should be able to use the `<Tldraw/>` component in any React editor.

To use the `<Tldraw/>` component, create a file like this one:

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from '@tldraw/tldraw'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/editor.css'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/ui.css'

export default function () {
	return (
		<div
			style={{
				position: 'fixed',
				inset: 0,
			}}
		>
			<Tldraw />
		</div>
	)
}
```

In addition to the library, you will also need to:

- import the **CSS files** for the editor and UI
- probably set a `viewport` meta tag in your **html**.

See below for more detail on these.

#### Next.js / SSR

The `<Tldraw/>` component cannot be server-rendered. If you're using the component in a Next.js app, you will need to import it dynamically. The code to do that will look something like this:

```tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic"

const Editor = dynamic(
	async () => import('../components/Editor')),
	{ ssr: false }
)

export default function MyPage() {
	return <Editor/>
}
```

### `<Tldraw/>`

The `<Tldraw/>` component combines several other pieces:

- the tldraw editor (`@tldraw/editor`)
- the tldraw UI (`@tldraw/ui`)
- an engine (`@tldraw/sync-client`) for persistence and cross-tab synchronization

> **Note:** In the future, this library will also include an engine for using our collaboration services.

If you wanted to have more granular control, you could also use those subcomponents directly. See the ["exploded" example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/apps/examples/src/5-exploded/ExplodedExample.tsx) for what that would look like.

### CSS

In order to use the `<Tldraw/>` component, you must also import a CSS file from the library `@tldraw/editor` library (automatically installed with `@tldraw/tldraw`):

```ts
import '@tldraw/tldraw/editor.css'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/ui.css'
```

You can overwrite these files with other CSS, customize the styles via package patches, or copy the contents into a different file and import that instead.

In addition to these stylesheets, the root project imports the `src/index.css` file, so its styles are used for every example. Be sure to take a look at this file: you may find some of these styles necessary in your own usage of the `<Tldraw/>` component.

### HTML

You probably also want to update your `index.html`'s meta viewport element as shown below. 

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
```

These may not be critical to `<Tldraw/>` performing correctly, however some features (such as safe area positioning) may not work correctly if these are not set.
