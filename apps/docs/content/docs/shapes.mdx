In tldraw, **shapes** are the things that are on the canvas. This article is about shapes: what they are, how they work, and how to create your own shapes. If you'd prefer to see an example, see the tldraw repository's [examples app](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/apps/examples) for examples of how to create custom shapes in tldraw.

## Custom shapes

Let's create a custom "card" shape.

### Shape type

In tldraw's data model, each shape is represented by a JSON object. Let's first create a type that describes what this object will look like. 

```ts
import { TLBaseShape } from '@tldraw/tldraw'

type CardShape = TLBaseShape<
  'card', 
  { w: number, h: number }
>
```

With the `TLBaseShape` helper, we define the shape's `type` property (`card`) and the shape's `props` property (`{ w: number, h: number }`). The type can be any string but the props must be a regular [JSON-serializable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#description) JavaScript object.

The `TLBaseShape` helper adds the other default properties of a shape, such as `parentId`, `x`, `y`, and `rotation`.

### Shape Util

While tldraw's shapes themselves are simple JSON objects, we use `ShapeUtil` classes to answer questions about shapes. For example, when the editor needs to know the bounding box of our card shape, it will find a `ShapeUtil` for the `card` type and call that util's `bounds` method, passing in the `CardShape` object as an argument.

Let's create a `ShapeUtil` class for the shape.

```tsx
import { ShapeUtil } from '@tldraw/tldraw'

class CardShapeUtil extends ShapeUtil<CardShape> {
  static type = 'card' as const

  getDefaultProps(): CardShape['props'] {
		return {
			w: 100,
			h: 100,
		}
	}

  getBounds(shape: Shape) {
		return new Box2d(0, 0, shape.props.w, shape.props.h)
	}
}
```

This is a minimal `ShapeUtil`. We've given it a static property `type` that matches the type of our shape, we've provided implementations for the abstract methods `getDefaultProps` and `getBounds`. There are a lot of other methods, such as
