Realtime multi-user collaboration on a tldraw canvas is possible using **tldraw sync**, an add-on library for tldraw. You can also integrate another sync engine, or your own custom sync layer, using tldraw's sync hooks.

## tldraw sync

tldraw sync is a library for fast, multiuser collaboration. It's purpose-built for the tldraw canvas, and is in use on our flagship app tldraw.com to power the shared whiteboards there.

### Try the demo server

The easiest way to start experimenting with multiplayer is with our demo server. Start by installing
`@tldraw/sync`:

```bash
npm install @tldraw/sync
```

Then, in your app, call the `useSyncDemo` hook with a room ID. It'll return a
[`store`](/docs/persistence#The-store-prop) that you can pass into the tldraw component:

```tsx
import { useSyncDemo } from '@tldraw/sync'

function MyApp() {
	const store = useSyncDemo({ roomId: 'myApp-abc123' })
	return <Tldraw store={store} />
}
```

Make sure the room ID is unique. Anyone who uses the same ID can access your room. Our sync demo
server is a great way to prototype multiplayer in tldraw, but it shouldn't be used in production.
Rooms will be deleted after 24 hours.

### Self-host a server

To use tldraw sync in production, you need to host the backend on your own server. There are three parts to sync in
tldraw:

1. The sync server, which serves the room over [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).
2. Somewhere to large assets that are too big to send over websockets, like images and videos.
3. The sync client, which connects to the server with the [`useSync`](?) hook.

You can start from our [Cloudflare Workers
template](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-sync-workers). This is a minimal setup of the
system that powers multiplayer collaboration for hundreds of thousands of rooms & users on
tldraw.com. It includes everything you need to get up and running with multiplayer tldraw quickly:
the sync server, asset hosting, and URL unfurling.

### Connect to your client

The [`useSync`](?) hook connects your backend to the tldraw editor. Call the hook to create a store,
then pass it in to the `<Tldraw />` component:

```tsx
function MyApp() {
	const store = useSync({
		uri: 'https://myapp.com/tlsocketroom/my-room-id',
		assets: myAssetStore,
	})

	return <Tldraw store={store} />
}

const myAssetStore: TLAssetStore {
	upload(file, asset) {
		return uploadFileAndReturnUrl(file)
	},
	resolve(asset) {
		return asset.props.src
	},
}
```

The sync client automatically enables some default collaborative UX which you can customize using
editor [component overrides](/reference/tldraw/TLComponents):

- Collaborator cursors: [`TLComponents#CollaboratorCursor`](?)
- Cursor chat: [`TLComponents#CursorChatBubble`](?)
- Offline indicator: [`TLComponents#TopPanel`](?)
- Collaborator list: [`TLComponents#SharePanel`](?)

## Other sync systems

While tldraw sync is the easiest way to add sync capabilities to your tldraw canvas, you can
also use other sync libraries or implement your own.

### Yjs

[tldraw-yjs example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-yjs-example) illustrates a way of using the [Yjs](https://yjs.dev) CRDT library with the tldraw SDK.

### Roll your own

For information about how to synchronize the store with other processes, i.e. how to get data out and put data in, including from remote sources, see the [Persistence](/docs/persistence) page.

## APIs

Here's more detail on the tldraw sync library workings, as well as the general sync hooks the tldraw editor.

### TLSocketRoom

The core part of tldraw sync is [`TLSocketRoom`](?). It works with any JavaScript-based web
framework with support for WebSockets, and any storage backend: it's up to you to wire in those
parts yourself.

Make sure there's only ever one `TLSocketRoom` for each room in your app. If there's
more than one, users won't see each other and will overwrite others' changes. We use [Durable
Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) to achieve this on tldraw.com.

If you don't want to our Cloudflare template, we also provide a [simple Node/Bun server
example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/apps/simple-server-example). This is not
production ready, but you can use it as a reference implementation to build it into your own
existing backend.

Read the reference docs for [`TLSocketRoom`](?) for more.

### User presence

tldraw has support for displaying the 'presence' of other users. Presence information consists of:

- The user's pointer position
- The user's set of selected shapes
- The user's viewport bounds (the part of the canvas they are currently viewing)
- The user's name, id, and a color to represent them

This information will usually come from two sources:

- The tldraw editor state (e.g. pointer position, selected shapes)
- The data layer of whichever app tldraw has been embedded in (e.g. user name, user id)

Tldraw is agnostic about how this data is shared among users. However, in order for tldraw to use the presence data it needs to be put into the editor's store as `instance_presence` records.

We provide a helper for constructing a reactive signal for an `instance_presence` record locally, which can then be sent to other clients somehow. It is called [createPresenceStateDerivation](?).

```ts
import { createPresenceStateDerivation, react, atom } from 'tldraw'

// First you need to create a Signal containing the basic user details: id, name, and color
const user = atom<{ id: string; color: string; name: string }>('user', {
	id: myUser.id,
	color: myUser.color,
	name: myUser.name,
})

// if you don't have your own user data backend, you can use our localStorage-only user preferences store
// import { getUserPreferences, computed } from 'tldraw'
// const user = computed('user', getUserPreferences)

// Then, with access to your store instance, you can create a presence signal
const userPresence = createPresenceStateDerivation(user)(store)

// Then you can listen for changes to the presence signal and send them to other clients
const unsub = react('update presence', () => {
	const presence = userPresence.get()
	broadcastPresence(presence)
})
```

The other clients would then call `store.put([presence])` to add the presence information to their store.

Any such `instance_presence` records tldraw finds in the store that have a different user `id` than the editor's configured user id will cause the presence information to be rendered on the canvas.

### Asset storage

As well as synchronizing the rapidly-changing document data, tldraw also needs a way to store and
retrieve large binary assets like images or videos.

You'll need to make sure your backend can handle asset uploads & downloads, then implement
[`TLAssetStore`](?) to connect it to tldraw.

- Read the [`TLAssetStore`](?) reference docs.
