The value of a particular [StyleProp](/gen/tlschema/StyleProp-class).


A `mixed` style means that in the current selection, there are lots of different values for the same style prop - e.g. a red and a blue shape are selected.


A `shared` style means that all shapes in the selection share the same value for this style prop.
