The [tldraw examples app](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/apps/examples/src) contains a lot of helpful examples showing how to customise the UI, use the editor API, handle assets, create custom shapes/tools and much more. However, the examples app is best experienced via cloning and running the [tldraw repo](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) locally.

We also have a couple of repos outside of the examples app: some [framework-specific examples](https://github.com/tldraw/examples), and an [example multiplayer implementation using Yjs](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-yjs-example).

### A simple example of the tldraw component:
