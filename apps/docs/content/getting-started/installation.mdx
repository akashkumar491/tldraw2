## Installation

Install the `@tldraw/tldraw` package using the `@beta` release tag.


```bash
npm i @tldraw/tldraw@beta
```

## Usage

Use the [Tldraw](?) component inside of any React component.

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from '@tldraw/tldraw'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function () {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw />
		</div>
	)
}
```

### Wrapper

By default, the [Tldraw](?) component's height and width are set to `100%`, so it will fill its parent container. You must place the component inside of a parent container with a specified height and width, or else use CSS to give the `.tl-container` class a height and width.

### CSS

The [Tldraw](?) component relies on CSS for styling. Depending on your framework or build system, you can import these in a JavaScript file:

```tsx
import '@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css'
```

...or from inside of another CSS file using the `@import` syntax:

```css
@import url('@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css');
```

> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Want to change how tldraw looks? You can always use your own CSS. Make a new CSS file in your project, copy the contents of our `tldraw.css` file, make your changes, and import your file instead.

### Fonts

The tldraw component's user interface will inherit the page's body font. If you'd like to use the same font that we use on [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com), import the [Inter font](https://github.com/rsms/inter) from Google fonts:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;700&display=swap');
```

### Viewport

If you're using the [Tldraw](?) component in a full-screen app, you may also want to update your `index.html`'s meta viewport element with the following properties:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
```

This may not be critical to [Tldraw](?) performing correctly, however some features (such as safe area positioning) will only work correctly if these viewport options are set.

## Frameworks

Visit our [framework examples repository](https://github.com/tldraw/examples) to see examples of tldraw being used in various frameworks.

## Server Rendering

The [Tldraw](?) component can't be server-rendered. If you're using the component in a server-rendered framework (such as Next.js) then you need to import it dynamically.

```tsx
const Tldraw = dynamic(async () => (await import('@tldraw/tldraw')).Tldraw, { ssr: false })
```

### Using a bundler

If you're using a bundler like webpack or rollup, you can import the assets directly from the `@tldraw/assets` package. Here you can use `getAssetUrlsByMetaUrl` helper function:

```tsx
import { getAssetUrlsByMetaUrl } from '@tldraw/assets/urls'

const assetUrls = getAssetUrlsByMetaUrl()

<Tldraw assetUrls={assetUrls} />
```

## Static Assets

In order to use the [Tldraw](?) component, the app must be able to find certain assets. These are contained in the `embed-icons`, `fonts`, `icons`, and `translations` folders. We offer a few different ways of making these assets available to your app.

### Using a public CDN

By default we serve these assets from a [public CDN called unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/@tldraw/assets@2.0.0-alpha.12/), so everything should work out of the box and is a good way to get started.

If you would like to customize some of the assets you can pass the customizations to our [Tldraw](?) component. For example, to use a custom icon for the `hand` tool you can do the following:

```tsx
const assetUrls = {
    icons: {
        'tool-hand': './custom-tool-hand.svg',
    },
}

<Tldraw assetUrls={assetUrls} />
```

This will use the custom icon for the `hand` tool and the default assets for everything else.

### Self-hosting static assets

If you want more flexibility you can also host these assets yourself:

1. Download the `embed-icons`, `fonts`, `icons`, and `translations` folders from the [assets folder](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/assets) of the tldraw repository.
2. Place the folders in your project's public path.
3. Pass `assetUrls` prop to our `<Tldraw/>` component to let the component know where the assets live.

You can use our `getAssetUrls` helper function from the `@tldraw/assets` package to generate these urls for you.

```tsx
import { getAssetUrls } from '@tldraw/assets/selfHosted'

const assetUrls = getAssetUrls()

<Tldraw assetUrls={assetUrls} />
```

While these files must be available, you can overwrite the individual files. For example, to change our icons, you can place a new icon under the same name. You can also modify translations in this same way.

If you use a CDN for hosting these files you can specify the base url of your assets. To recreate the above option of serving the assets from unpkg you would do the following:

```ts
const assetUrls = getAssetUrls({
	baseUrl: 'https://unpkg.com/@tldraw/assets@2.0.0-alpha.12/',
})
```
