### Add a tldraw canvas to your React app in just 5 minutes.

The tldraw sdk provides a really simple way to craft infinite canvas experiences for the web. It's perfect for collaborative applications, productivity tools, interfacing with multi modal ai, and more.

By the end of this guide you will have made something that looks like this: 

<Embed className="article__embed--quickstart" width="75%" src="https://vite-template-five.vercel.app/" />

Follow this link to see the [deployed version of the app](https://vite-template-five.vercel.app/).
Follow the steps below to make your own version of it, or [clone the repo](https://github.com/tldraw/vite-template) to skip to the end.

    ### Installation

    - Set up a React project however you normally do. [We recommend Vite.](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).
    - Install the tldraw library using this command:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @tldraw/tldraw@beta
    ```
  </li>
  <li>
    ### Import Styles
    <br />
    To import fonts and CSS for tldraw:

    - Create or edit a css file called index.css 
    - Copy and paste this into the file:
    ```CSS
    @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;700&family=Roboto+Mono:wght@400;700&display=swap");
    @import url("@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css");

    body {
      font-family: "Inter";
    }
    ```
  </li>
  <li>
    ### Render Tldraw Component
    <br />
    To render the Tldraw component

    - Import the ```<Tldraw />``` component from “@tldraw/tldraw”
    - Import our CSS file from earlier, index.css
    - Wrap the Tldraw component in a div with the style attribute set to: ```{position: 'fixed', inset: 0}``` 
    
    <p className="">This will render a full screen canvas:</p>

    ```javascript
    import { Tldraw } from "@tldraw/tldraw";
    import "./index.css";

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
          <Tldraw />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
  </li>
</ol>
