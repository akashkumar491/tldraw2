## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.2.0](/releases/v3.2.0)

Welcome to the `v3.2.0` release of tldraw!

### Oops

We accidentally clicked the 'publish new version' button ü§¶üèº so there have been no actual changes in this release.

Please refer to the [release notes for `v3.1.0`](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/releases/tag/v3.1.0) to see what changed since the `v3.0.x` branch.

Sorry pals!
