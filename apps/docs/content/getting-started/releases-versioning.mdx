## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v2.4.0](/releases/v2.4.0)

Welcome to the 2.4.0 release of the tldraw SDK. This month we’ve been working to bring our sync engine (the backend we developed for tldraw.com) into the SDK as a technology for general use. This release also includes new animation options for shapes, support for image flipping, and a long list of bug fixes and developer experience enhancements. Read on for the highlights and see the bottom of these notes for the list of significant fixes and changes.

Thank you also to our first-time contributors Albert Brand ([@AlbertBrand](https://github.com/AlbertBrand)) and Guillaume Grossetie ([@ggrossetie](https://github.com/ggrossetie))!

#### What's new

##### Sync

For the first time, we’re releasing our real-time collaboration engine—the one we developed for tldraw.com—as a general library that developers can use for their own projects. The SDK will of course still support any backend for collaboration, however we hope this will be the best and easiest for developers to use alongside the rest of the tldraw SDK. While we’re shipping the code in this release, we still have some work to do on our messaging and our documentation, so keep an eye out for an announcement in the coming weeks. For now, see the new `sync` package in the repository and the new multiplayer-demo example in the tldraw repository.

##### Interpolation

Did you know that tldraw has basic support for animation? You can use the `Editor.animateShapes` method to animate shapes on the canvas, but up to now only the position and rotation properties would be animated. In this release, we’ve given the `ShapeUtil` class a new `getInterpolatedProps` method. You can use this to describe how your custom shape’s other properties should be animated. We’ve only started to implement this feature for our own shapes, but check our `BaseBoxShapeUtil` as an example.

```ts
override getInterpolatedProps(startShape: Shape, endShape: Shape, t: number): Shape['props'] {
	return {
		...endShape.props,
		w: lerp(startShape.props.w, endShape.props.w, t),
		h: lerp(startShape.props.h, endShape.props.h, t),
	}
}
```

##### `Editor.run`

You can use the new `Editor.run` method to run a function within some additional context. By default, the function will be run inside of a transaction, meaning that all changes made during the transaction will be settled at once. This improves performance and avoids unnecessary renders in the user interface. You can also use `Editor.run`’s contextual options to ignore history or ignore locked shapes.

```ts
editor.run(
	() => {
		editor.createShapes(myShapes)
		editor.sendToBack(myShapes)
		editor.selectNone()
	},
	{ history: 'ignore' }
)
```

##### Assets

As part of our work on sync, we have a new system for handling large assets like images and videos. You can provide a [`TLAssetStore`](https://tldraw.dev/reference/tlschema/TLAssetStore) to control how assets are uploaded and retrieved.

In your own shapes & tools, these options are available through the new [`Editor.uploadAsset`](https://tldraw.dev/reference/editor/Editor#uploadAsset) and [`Editor.resolveAssetURL`](https://staging.tldraw.dev/reference/editor/Editor#resolveAssetUrl) methods.

#### Breaking changes

- `editor.history.ignore(cb)` has been replaced with `editor.run(cb, {history: ‘ignore’})`
- `editor.batch` is deprecated, replaced with `editor.run`
- If you’re importing from `@tldraw/state` directly, the `track` function and all hooks (e.g. `useValue`) have moved to `@tldraw/state-react`.
