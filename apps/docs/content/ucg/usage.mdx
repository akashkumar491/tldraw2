The `<Tldraw/>` component is the easiest way to get started with tldraw. It combines several lower-level libraries: the `TldrawEditor` component from `@tldraw/editor` and the `TldrawUi` component from `@tldraw/ui`.

To use the `<Tldraw/>` component, create a file like this one:

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from '@tldraw/tldraw'
import '@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function TldrawExample() {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }} >
			<Tldraw />
		</div>
	)
}
```

### CSS

In order to use the `<Tldraw/>` component, you should also import the `tldraw.css` file from the `@tldraw/tldraw` library. You can alternatively import this file inside of another CSS file using the `@import` syntax.

You can overwrite these files with other CSS or copy the contents into a different file and import that instead.

### HTML

If you're using the tldraw component in a full-screen app, you probably also want to updte your `index.html`'s meta viewport element as shown below. 

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
```

This change may not be critical to `<Tldraw/>` performing correctly, however some features (such as safe area positioning) will not work correctly if these viewport options are not set.

## Server rendering

The `<Tldraw/>` component can't be server-rendered. If you're using the component in a server-rendered framework (such as Next.js) then you will need to import it dynamically. Check the [examples repository](https://github.com/tldraw/examples) to see examples.

## Using in Next.js, Create React App, Vite, etc.

Check the [examples repository](https://github.com/tldraw/examples) to see examples of the tldraw component being used in various frameworks.

## Going deeper

If you wanted to have more granular control, you could also use those lower-level components directly. See [this example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/blob/main/apps/examples/src/5-exploded/ExplodedExample.tsx) for reference.
