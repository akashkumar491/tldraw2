You can customize tldraw's actions menu. Open the actions menu by clicking the "..." button in the menu, next to undo and redo, or just above the toolbar on mobile. There should be a new menu item there.

The help menu can be customized by providing a `<CustomActionsMenu>` component as a child of the `<Tldraw>` component.
