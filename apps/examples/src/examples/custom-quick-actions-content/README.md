You can customize tldraw's quick actions content. Quick actions are the buttons that appear next to the menu button, or in the toolbar on smaller sizes.

---

The help menu content can be customized by providing a `QuickActionsContent` component to the `Tldraw` component's `uiComponents` prop. If you provide `null`, then that component will be hidden.
