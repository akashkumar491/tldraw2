## Introduction

In tldraw, a **tool** is a state that the user can be in. For example, the user can be in the select tool, the draw tool, or the arrow tool.

In other words, a tool is a [`StateNode`](/gen/editor/StateNode) of tldraw's "state chart". This tree of `StateNode` instances contains the logic for the user's interactions. User interactions such as moving the cursor will produce different changes to the state depending on which nodes are active.
