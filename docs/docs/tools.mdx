## Introduction

In tldraw, a **tool** is what we call any top-level state in our state chart. For example, the select tool, the draw tool, and the arrow tool are all top-level states that the user can be in.

For more detailed information about the state chart, and how it works, go to the [Editor page](editor). Or read below for more information about tools, and how to make your own.

## Types of tool

The tldraw editor comes with some in-built **core tools**: the [select tool](/gen/editor/SelectTool), the [zoom tool](/gen/editor/ZoomTool), and the [text tool](/gen/editor/TextTool). These are always added to the state chart.

There are also some **default tools** available, like the [draw tool](/gen/editor/DrawShapeTool), the [hand tool](/gen/editor/HandTool), the [arrow tool](/gen/editor/ArrowTool), and more. The `<Tldraw>` component automatically adds these tools to the state chart. 

You can also create your own **custom tools**. You can add them to the state chart by passing an array of them to the [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/editor/Tldraw) component's `tools` prop.

Note: You might also want to add a tool to the user interface in various ways, such as the toolbar. That isn't documented here yet, but you can see how it's done in our [examples folder](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/apps/examples/src/3-custom-config). 

## Inside a tool

Every tool has an **id**. This is used to identify it in the state chart.

```ts
class MyTool extends StateNode {
  static override id = 'my-tool'
}
```

Tools can contain **children**. For example, the [hand tool](/gen/editor/HandTool) has three children, `Idle`, `Pointing` and `Dragging`. If a state has children, it must also have an `initial` state, so that it knows which state to start in.

```ts
class MyIdleState extends StateNode {
  static override id = 'my-idle-state'
}

class MyPointingState extends StateNode {
  static override id = 'my-pointing-state'
}

class MyTool extends StateNode {
  static override id = 'my-tool'
  static override initial = 'my-idle-state'
  static override children = [MyIdleState, MyPointingState]
}
```
