The type of resize.


'scale_shape' - The shape is being scaled, usually as part of a larger selection.


'resize_bounds' - The user is directly manipulating an individual shape's bounds using a resize handle. It is up to shape util implementers to decide how they want to handle the two situations.


##### Signature


```ts
type TLResizeMode = 'resize_bounds' | 'scale_shape'
```
