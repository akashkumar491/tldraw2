# Cat Customs - Custom Editor API Samples

![Paw draw editor ](documentation/example.png)

Demonstrates VS Code's [custom editor API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors) using two custom editors:

- Cat Scratch â€” Uses the finalized custom text editor api to provide a custom editor for `.cscratch` files (which are just json files)
- Paw Draw - Uses the binary custom editor api to provide a custom editor for `.pawdraw` files (which are just png files with a different file extension).
